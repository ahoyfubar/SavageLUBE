# SlogBlocker

SlogBlocker is a Safari Extension that rearranges and improves the DOM when viewing the comments section for the [Savage Love Blog (SLOG)](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove).

1. It creates duplicate page navigation buttons at the top of the comments pages.
2. It moves the name of each writer from the end of their comment to the top.
3. It allows you to click a writer's avatar, and select a replacement avatar of your own.
4. It allows you to mute a writer. 
5. If a writer is muted, you can click "Show Comment" to read what they wrote.
