# SavageLUBE

The Savage Love Usability Browser Enhancement (SavageLUBE) is a browser extension that rearranges and improves the comments section for the [Savage Love advice column](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove) using Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and several others.

1. It can create duplicate page navigation buttons at the top of the comments pages.
2. It can move the name of each writer from the end of their comment to the top.
3. It can turn @ mentions (e.g., fubar @123) into hyperlinks.
4. It can show the writer's name when you hover over their avatar.
5. It allows you to click a writer's avatar, and select a replacement avatar of your own.
6. It allows you to block a writer. They no longer appear in the comments pages. You can unblock a writer in the SavageLUBE Extension settings (see below).
7. It allows you to mute a writer. They appear, but their comments are not shown. If a writer is muted, you can click "Show Comment" to read what they wrote.
8. It allows you to highlight a writer. Their comments will be emphasized and easy to find.
