# SlogBlocker

SlogBlocker is a browser extension that rearranges and improves the comments section for the [Savage Love Blog (SLOG)](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove) using Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and several others.

1. It creates duplicate page navigation buttons at the top of the comments pages.
2. It moves the name of each writer from the end of their comment to the top.
3. It turns @ mentions (e.g., fubar @123) into hyperlinks.
4. It allows you to click a writer's avatar, and select a replacement avatar of your own.
5. It allows you to block a writer. They no longer appear in the comments pages. You can unblock a writer in the SlogBlocker Extension settings (see below).
6. It allows you to mute a writer. They appear, but their comments are not shown. If a writer is muted, you can click "Show Comment" to read what they wrote.
7. It allows you to highlight a writer. Their comments will be emphasized and easy to find.
